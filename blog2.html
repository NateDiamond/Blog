          Today, in classical Ithaca fashion, I woke up to
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen/dp/B0792KTHKJ">Alexa</a> warning me that it was
          freezing rain! First of all, how is freezing rain even a thing? Isn't that just snow? <br /> <br />
          <img class="centered-image" src=mathlady.gif />
          <br /> <br />
          Regardless, I knew I needed to grab an umbrella. Immediately, my mind went to the free umbrella we got on
          Birthright. My first reaction was temporary relief—now I'll get to stay dry! Then, my mind started to
          wander. What if it said something "Jew-y" on it? I didn't feel comfortable touting Israeli-themed
          paraphernalia around campus. But why was that? I have an
          <a href=https://www.optiver.com/na/en/> Optiver</a> umbrella that I sport frequently on rainy days, and that
            makes less sense given they rejected me! <br /><br />
          Does my hesitance to take this umbrella with me say more about the campus climate surrounding Israel or my
          own insecurity about my Judaism? Honestly, despite <a href=https://cornellsun.com/2018/11/20/three-swastikas-in-9-days-spate-of-anti-semitic-incidents-on-north-campus-stokes-fear/>issues
            on campus</a> in the past, I actually believe it is the latter that drove my thought process this morning.
            Cornell is <a href=https://www.hillel.org/college-guide/list/record/cornell-university>20% Jewish</a>,
            though I was one of the only Jews in my high school of over 1000 students (so maybe a couple of percentage
            points if I'm being generous). I'm used to being singled out as a Jew without even trying. It is thus
            habitual for me to try and not draw further attention to this fact. <br /><br />
          Here's a question: Would I ever wear a kippah on campus? <br />The answer—probably not. I'm not talking
          about
          at a religious event or a Shabbat dinner. I mean walking between classes in broad daylight. <br /><b>A)</b>
          I
          would never even think to do this because I never did this with my family, and a large part of my Judaism
          is
          centered around inherited traditions—though recently I've added a new twist of reducing work and
          technological use on Shabbat that has never been done in the Diamond household. <br /><b>B)</b> Even if
          someone suggested I try it, I would feel uncomfortable. I would be lying if I said I didn't notice "those
          kids" that wear kippot around campus. This is a prime example of my own biases against Jews (yes, even as a
          Jew) that I must fight. <br /><br />
          I guess in a way, an Israel umbrella is a lot like a kippah. Both cover your head. Both identify you as a
          Jew. And both make me uncomfortable in certain settings. Fortunately, a wise Birthright tour guide once
          told
          me that the best learning is done when you're uncomfortable.</div>
