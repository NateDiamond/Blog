          I forgot that I wrote this! Tatiana, a coordinator on our Birthright trip, had asked me to write a short piece
          about the Birthright trip. I actually think this should have been my first post, but better late than never!

          “All right everyone, go and find your angels!” chirped our tour guide Matan before letting us loose into the
          streets of Sefad. On the bus ride over he had told us of the magic that lay in the city—tales of past
          Birthright participants having a holy experience with the residents of this charming town in Northern Israel.
          One girl had even cried she was so moved by the experience of meeting her angel in Sefad. Our trip received
          this story with a mix of excitement and skepticism. Thus began our third day of Birthright. </br> </br>
          I set out with two of my closest friends from Cornell, Ethan and Joe, and together we went down cobblestone
          pathways and stairways carved into a giant hill. Along the way, we ran into another group of people on our
          trip who had the same idea as us. Some of them we had gotten to know intimately already, including an Israeli
          soldier named Nir who was delightfully entranced in his thoughts quite often. Others might as well have been
          strangers, but it didn’t matter—everyone on the trip was open to making friends. It may have been because they
          were equally vulnerable being in a new country with no definitive relationships yet established, but I sensed
          it was something deeper. It felt as if I were being reunited with old family members. </br> </br>
          With this new group, we wandered into a cheese shop that looked more like a home than a store. I bought some
          Halva, a sesame and honey-based treat that makes for an amazing breakfast. Others relished samples of soft
          cheese the owner was kind enough to share. We secretly joked that this may have been our angel, but deep down
          we knew that this was not the case. </br> </br>
          Though bereft of spiritual enlightenment, we returned back towards the main marketplace with Halva in hands
          and cheese in our stomachs. Later, some of us would haggle for gifts that we would exchange later during
          Shabbat in Jerusalem. This adventure in itself could have kept us preoccupied for the entirety of the day, but
          alas we had the beautiful city of Haifa left to visit, where we would see many other astounding sights, most
          notably the magnificent Bahai Gardens. </br> </br>
          Later, on the bus, Matan asked us if anyone had seen an angel. Most of the bus was silent, save the bright and
          energetic Nicole. Apparently, there was an old woman who had “seen Nicole’s eyes before the woman had gotten a
          chance to look at them.” Nicole’s eyes were a particularly vibrant green, perhaps a window to her equally
          fiery soul, so maybe there was a profundity to this encounter. </br> </br>
          That was when I realized that spiritual enlightenment would only find those sought after it. It would not be
          waiting neatly on the doorstep for the dejected atheists. It would not be hanging in a frame for those with
          closed hearts. It was floating all throughout the air, and had to be grabbed by the horns and wrangled into
          submission, only to escape and have to be caught all over again. This was when I opened my mind to Birthright.
          This is when I let go of all preconceptions and beliefs so deeply rooted in me. This was when I first allowed
          the possibility for enlightenment back into my world, for the first time since I was a kid. I didn’t realize
          it at the
          time, but it turns out I had already found enlightenment on that trip, the second I had reconnected with my
          ancient Jewish family in Sefad.
