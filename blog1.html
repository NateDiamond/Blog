          It's really hard not to get upset about politics. There's something so visceral about feeling attacked
          over your true beliefs—the ones that really are tied to your identity. Sure, I get mad about <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/trump-birth-control-mandate.html>Trump
            being an idiot and trying to take away birth control</a>, but I am sure it would really hit home if I were
            a woman whose reproductive rights were actually at stake. My sister went as far as calling it
            "enslaving with a child" (she had <a href=http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/hyperemesis-gravidarum/>
            hyperemesis</a>), and honestly, I agree with her. Thus, no matter how hard I try, it's something to which I
            am incapable of having the same gut reaction. It is physically impossible, despite however much sympathy I
            can conjure. <br /><br />
          In fact, there are very few political issues where I feel very personally attacked. As
          a heterosexual white male, I recognize my background of privilege. While I support the rights of many
          minority groups, I have never been attacked in the same way that they have. There is really only one issue
          that affects me fundamentally as a person, and I struggle with this all the time. <br /><br />
          I am a Jew. Though a persecuted minority throughout the course of human history, the modern American Jew
          seems to have little to worry about save anti-Semitic middle school jokes and <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/us/active-shooter-pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html>extreme
            cases of terror attacks</a>—so maybe a bit to worry about when normal life is interrupted.<br /><br />
          However, I am starting to challenge if the American Jew is still safe or will still be safe in the years to
          come from a very intense form of identity politics. Ever since my trip to Israel, I feel as though the land
          and now the country are tied inseparably to my identity. The land, being home to a rich array of geographical
          and historical beauties, is a place where I feel at home. This is not where the politics come in though. I
          have no problem in my mind if the Jews were to share the land. <br /><br />
          For me, the root of the attack stems from the continually twisting worldview on the country of Israel. First,
          the amount of historical ignorance surrounding the conflict is appalling—and this is coming from someone who
          knew very little about the subject only a single month ago. How hypocritical! Yet now, I realize how quick
          people are to jump on a bandwagon against something about which they know so little. And again, how critical
          am I, the person willing to throw other countries under the bus just to take the light off of Israel. <br /><br />
          Maybe that is why this has been the wrong approach so far—I am only spreading ignorance that way! What people
          need is a true education surrounding the history of Israel. Only then would we be able to combat the unjust
          virus that is BDS. It's not that all people who support BDS are anti-Semitic (although everyone is
          anti-Semitic, including myself, in the same way that <a href=https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html>everyone
            is a little racist, xenophobic, sexist, etc.</a>), but it is true, however, that the movement itself is
            founded on an anti-Semitic agenda meant to <a href=http://reut-institute.org/data/uploads/PDFVer/20100612%20ReViews%20-%20BDS%20Issue%2016_1.pdf>
            delegitimize</a> the state of Israel, <a href=https://theintercept.com/2018/12/14/bds-israel-boycott-ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib/?comments=1#comments>despite
            protests of its exponents</a>. <br /><br />
          I tried writing an article explaining how I thought "BDS is anti-Palestinian," meaning that although it
          supports the state of Palestine, it ultimately is not in the best interest of its people. The truth is, I am
          not the one fit to write such an article (and it is not even the point I need to make). As much as I have
          researched and try to understand the Palestinian narrative, at the end of the day I am a Jew with my own set
          of self-preserving interests (aren't we all?), and even if my thesis holds any validity from a logical
          perspective it can hold no <a href=https://www.mikeruso.com/blog/emotional-truth/>emotional truth</a>. This
            is for the same reason I can support pro-choice but I will never <b>be</b> pro-choice (clarification: I
            "am" pro-choice but I will never be able to truly internalize it in the same way a woman can). <br /><br />
            So, my approach can only be one of Jewish identity. It can only be explaining how <a href=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jewish-population-of-the-world>14
              million Jews</a> are vastly outnumbered by a world with over a billion Muslims. My sentiment of
              supporting Israel may very well be the voice of a minority, because the world is majority non-Jew by a
              longshot. By a 99.8% longshot to be precise. Maybe, for the first time in my life, I am feeling what it's
              like to be a minority—even if it's only on a single issue. But that one issue is not even about my native
              country! Yet somehow, I still feel punched in the gut when someone says something that is anti-Israel.
              Are you starting to see the internal conflict? <br /><br />
            We were playing <a href=https://jackboxgames.com/project/quiplash/>this party game</a> today where players
              suggest clever answers to suggestive prompts and vie for crowd support/votes. One prompt was,
              "What would you name a made-up country?" The two answers for which we had to vote? You guessed it: Israel
              and Palestine. Immediately, almost instinctively, I found myself voting for Palestine. My brain triggered
              a self-defense mechanism. When people starting talking about what just happened, I again caught myself
              trying to pick a fight with those around me. I felt like I was playing goalie for Israeli politics in my
              house. <br /><br />
            Upon reflection, I realized that other people could have had a completely opposite reaction. If a
            Palestinian
            had been in the room, would they have stormed out in anger that our group voted majority "Palestine"
            (though
            a slim majority, which further upset me)? This got me thinking—why should I care so much about my friends'
            thoughts on this one political issue? I have friends who voted for Trump and that has in no way affected
            our
            relationship (or if it has, the effects were marginal and subconscious). Why am I not more riled up that
            someone voted for a sexist idiot in my native country? I would say it's because I'm not a woman, but the
            enigma is that <a href=https://qz.com/833003/election-2016-all-women-voted-overwhelmingly-for-clinton-except-the-white-ones/>Trump
              captured over 40% of the woman vote</a>—42% to be precise. <br /><br />
            I was mad for being so hurt about this. My Jewish identity has always been paramount, but never has the
            Israel topic felt so <b>visceral</b> (yes, I use the word again because it truly captures how I feel, and I
            found no good synonyms in the thesaurus). This is one of the questions I'll have to ponder as I continue
            the
            quest for understanding my Jewish question. However, I will end by saying it sometimes feel like I am
            facing
            a multiple choice quiz that looks as follows:<br /><br />
            <b>When People Ignorantly Attack Israel, What Do You Do?</b> <br />
            A) Lecture them about the "true" history until they fall asleep (I don't blame them; I sometimes doze off
            when my dad launches into a historical tirade). <br />
            B) Internalize your anger and watch a piece of your Jewish identity chip away. <br />
            C) Angrily retaliate and make them more anti-Israel because you're being a fucking angry Jew. <br />
            D) Say something passive aggressive and ruin the party.
